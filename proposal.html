	            <h3><a href="">Digital Story Proposal</a></h3>
	            <p>I would like to make my digital story into some sort of musical game. I am not quite sure of the logistics yet but it would be cool to create some sort of musical story with interactive instruments and sounds. I was thinking about either a game or something where you kind of build an instrument, or build a mini band as you navigate the web page. It would have to include artistic elements that I would sketch myself, but also moving images and sounds. 

		Depending on how complex I want the idea to be, I will either focus on one instrument or have a couple. The 	story would be about the history of the instrument and its historical significance, as well as pop culture references. For example the web page would include a simple drum kit and then the viewer would be able to “play” the instrument, click on different parts to learn about it, and also learn about famous drummers. I think it would make sense to have the website work as a web/map, that way the viewer will be able to move about as they please, as there will be no specific order for where to go.

		I am unsure of how complicated this will be, so I am sure this idea will change. I want to create a more meaningful story to tell so I have a lot of work to do as we begin working on our digital stories.
