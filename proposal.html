	            <h3><a href="">Digital Story Proposal</a></h3>
	            <p>            For my web journal I would like to explore a story I had come across in the Washington Post about a pet goldfish being innocently released into a nearby pond. I was drawn to the article because of the comically large goldfish on the cover, it almost seemed like satire. After reading the article I realized that there was more to the story than just the hilarity of an absurdly large goldfish. There is an impending issue regarding household pets being released into the wild or outside habitats that they are not meant to be a part of. This goldfish serves as just one example of the many pets that are wrongly released. As a result, these animals interfere with the other species in a given habitat and disrupt their ecosystem, often acting as a new predator and competing with the other animals. In this case, the goldfish competes with these other species and eats their food, hence their ridiculous size. <p>


				<p> I ran into a similar issue when I was trying to get rid of my pet turtle a few years ago. Initially I assumed I would be able to simply release it back into the pond with the other red eared sliders. However, I soon learned that doing so would only disrupt the other species and their habitats, as well as put my own pet turtle in a harmful situation. Thankfully I was able to find someone who was looking for a pet turtle, so Cheddar is currently safe and being taken care of by a happy pet owner. But I am only one lucky example of the countless pet owners who have run into this issue. It appears not many are aware of how releasing pets into the wild is not only harmful for the surrounding species, but their own pet as well.<p>


				<p> I want to create a story about a pet goldfish and his journey back into the wild. My plan is to keep it colorful and playful, with an almost comic-like style, as if telling a cautionary tale. I don’t want the story to be too sad or too informative, but almost the kind of story you show to a child to make them laugh. The user (you) will buy the goldfish from the pet store and take it home. I want to use bright, fun colors and fun graphics to keep it lighthearted. I will either tell the story from the point of view of the fish or keep it interactive between the user and the story. After losing excitement the user will have the option to get rid of the pet goldfish. The user will have the option to flush it down the toilet or release it into the local pond where it will proceed to grow extremely large, as seen in the article. Or if it is told from the point of view of the fish, the fish will proceed to be disposed of (alive). As comical as it is, when these goldfish grow extremely large, they disrupt the other native species in these ponds and often serve as predators. I will depict the fish as sad and completely out of place to show how he doesn’t belong in this new habitat. I want there to be some message at the end, or maybe a link to some resources for pet owners looking to safely get rid of their pets.<p>
